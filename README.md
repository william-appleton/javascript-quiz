# javascript-quiz

For this application a browser run quiz on the fundamentals of javascript was built using vanilla javascript primarily. The opening page instructs the user how to begin the course and describes the rules. If a question is answered incorrectly a 'wrong' message is shown, and if the user answers correctly they are taken to the next question.

The question changes are all handled by dynamically updating the html through javascript. At the end of the quiz the user can enter in their initials, which will be saved and displayed below, along with their score.

A live link to the page can be found here: https://william-appleton.github.io/javascript-quiz/
